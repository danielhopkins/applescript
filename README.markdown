This is a collection of Apple scripts. I've been running using [fastscripts](http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/) to map key commands to different scripts.

## Archive message ##
I started using this in my quest for zero inbox in Mail.app 5.0. This script moves messags out of the inbox and to "All Mail", which effectively archives.

### todo ###
    - Get rid of hard coded links, otherwise people have to fix the script and it won't work in a multi-account environment.

## Other script ideas ##
    - Coffee shop mode: locks down the computer
        - turns on firewall and stealth mode
        - disable sharing
        - turn on a password protect screen saver
    - Public mode: does the opposite of coffee shop mode
    - Mark as gmail spam: moves to spam folder, similar to archive script
